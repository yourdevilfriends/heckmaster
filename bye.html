            <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070226104700/http://www.nightmarevalley.com/Main.php"><img src="/heckmaster/img/button/nightmarevalley.gif" alt="Valley of Nightmares"></a>; An old fansite that was quite popular when it was up. Has a certain edge that a lot of fansites lacked.</p>

Crusade</a>; I thought it was the website of a potential cult at first, but it seems to be a website about a lady's personal philosophy and ideals. I find myself agreeing with her on a lot of things, though the world she evisions is too utopian to be realistic.</p>
            <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120507105220/http://www.arkeis.com/"><img src="/heckmaster/img/button/arkeis.jpg" alt="Arkeis"></a>; One of the first fansites I ever visited, dedicated to Pokémon. It was maintained by a very skilled artist that seemingly doesn't have an online presence anymore.</p>
