            <h1>Day of the Tentacle</h1>
            <q>Dr. Fred's mutated purple tentacle is about to take over the world, and only you can stop him!</q>
            <p>This is the very first phrase in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/388210/Day_of_the_Tentacle_Remastered/" target="_blank">Steam page for Day of the Tentacle Remastered</a>. It doesn't tell you much, but then again, nothing can prepare you for the insane twists within this point-and-click game.</p>
            <p>«But, what's this game all about?» is something you might be asking yourself. The story of DOTT starts off absurd and gets increasingly nonsensical. It goes as follows..</p>
            <h2>The plot of the game</h2>
            <p>Five years passed since the events of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_Mansion" target="_blank">Maniac Mansion</a> (which you can play as an easter egg in DOTT or <a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Maniac_Mansion_1987" target="_blank">for free in the Internet Archive</a>), and all is peaceful.. that is, until Purple Tentacle- a mutant monster created by the mad scientist Dr. Fred Edison- drinks a toxic sludge coming from Dr. Fred's laboratory that causes him to grow arms. Now <em>armed</em>, Purple Tentacle vows to take over the world.</p>
            <p>Dr. Fred plans to stop Purple Tentacle by killing him and his harmless brother Green Tentacle, but Green Tentacle sends his old friend, Bernard Bernoulli, a letter asking for help. Accompanied by his friend Laverne and Hoagie, Bernard goes back to the mansion and frees the tentacles. Purple Tentacle then escapes, resuming his quest for world domination.</p>
            <p>To fix this, Dr. Fred sends Bernard, Laverne and Hoagie back to the previous day with his Chron-o-John time machines to turn off the machine that produced the sludge in the first place. However, the machines malfunction horribly- Hoagie is now back 200 years in the past, Laverne is 200 years in the future, and Bernard is in the present.</p>
            <p>.. and the rest is up to you to discover! No, seriously, <em>please</em> give this game a chance. A plot synopsis doesn't do it justice. Just in case you're not convinced, here's some of my favorite parts of the game:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Freezing a hamster and unfreezing it 200 years later (in a microwave, of course).</li>
                <li>Winning a human contest with a dead body and spaghetti.</li>
                <li>Using a paid dryer to dry a sweater.. for 200 years. Many coins were spent.</li>
                <li>Rewriting the United States Constitution.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>My history with this game</h2>
            <p>Day of the Tentacle was the very first video game I ever played. The game is rather old, having been published in 1993 (even before I was born!), yet I found myself playing it in 2004. I was 6, and as a Portuguese toddler who hadn't had proper contact with the English language, I obviously could never get very far. I didn't even know how to save the game, in fact!</p>
            <p>In early 2022, almost a decade later, I bought the remastered version in a fit of nostalgia. And y'know what? I'm glad I did, because it's legitimately one of the funniest goddamn pieces of media I ever consumed.</p>
            <h2>The humor of DOTT</h2>
            <p>DOTT is overly nonsensical at times, meaning you have to think outside of the box an absurd amount (or, y'know, check a walkthrough). It's a bit frustrating at times because of that.</p>
            <p>However, it makes up for by being consistently funny. Sure, some jokes are America-centric (meaning that I didn't quite get some of them) and some feel a bit dated, but I found the majority of the game to have the kind of absurdist humor I love.</p>
            <p>The slapstick is pretty nice too, mainly because the animations are so smooth- even if it's not the kind of comedy you enjoy, at least you're looking at some pretty neat art.</p>
            <p>It doesn't shy away from dark jokes either (there's even a suicide joke at one point), which is something I really appreciate. They're not offensive or anything (at least from my point of view), but there's a lot of violent instances within the game that are always played for laughs.</p>
