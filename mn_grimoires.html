            The Grimoires</h1>

            <p>The Grimoires are special items unique to MN which offer pretty neat perks. Besides the utility they provide, they also vary in rarity and demand.</p>
            <p>In this short guide, we'll be looking at each Grimoire and what they do, as well as how to get them.</p>

            <!--Animalis-->
            <h2 id="animalis">Animalis</h2>
            <p>Although you start with 24 pet slots, these can quickly become full if you like many different pets... each Animalis you use grants you an additional pet slot, solving this little conundrum.</p>
            <img src="/heckmaster/img/guides/animalis.gif" class="center" >
            <p>Since you cannot have more than one account, these prove to be quite useful if you're into having lots of different pets.</p>
            <p>You can buy them from the Magical Bookshop or the Hidden Tower, though it is rare to see on the former.</p>
            <hr>
            <!--Eritque Arcus-->
            <h2 id="eritque-arcus">Eritque Arcus</h2>
            <p>Perhaps the most sought after item in MN, Eritque Arcus allows you to take a dip in the Rainbow Fountain to paint your pet in almost any color you'd like.</p>
            <img src="/heckmaster/img/guides/eritque-arcus.gif" class="center">
            <p>Even if you're not looking to change the color of your pets, they're very valuable in trades with other users.</p>
            <p><strong>Please note that not all colors are available from the Rainbow Fountain!</strong> Check the All Neopet Colours link under the Rainbow Pool to check whether the color you want is available from the Fountain.</p>
            <p>It's most commonly seen at the Hidden Tower, although it's possible to see it being sold in the Faerieland Bookshop sometimes as well.</p>
            <hr>
            <!--Mutare Naturam-->
            <h2 id="mutare-naturam">Mutare Naturam</h2>
            <p>If you have a pet you're attached to but feel the need to change something about them, this item will come in handy. Using Mutare Naturam allows you to change anything about your Neopet's nature, such as their name and gender.</p>
            <img src="/heckmaster/img/guides/mutare-naturam.png" class="center">
            <p>They're available at Sutek's Scrolls, the Magical Bookshop, Neovian Printing Press, Words of Antiquity, Brightvale Books, and the Hidden Tower.</p>
            <hr>
            <!--Occultus Loco-->
            <h2 id="occultus-loco">Occultus Loco</h2>
            <p>If you're looking for map pieces, getting an Occultus Loco might help you out. Each one grants you 3 different map pieces when used.</p>
            <img src="/heckmaster/img/guides/occultus-loco.png" class="center">
            <p>Please note that you might find map pieces you already have when you use one. If that happens, selling or trading the repeated pieces is a good idea.</p>
            <p>They're available at the Hidden Tower, though you may also see them being sold at the Neovian Printing Press.</p>
            <hr>
            <!--Spatium Procuratio-->
            <h2 id="spatium-procuratio">Spatium Procuratio</h2>
            <p>If you're struggling with lack of space in your inventory, check this one out. Each Spatium Procuratio you use gets you an additional 25 slots to either your inventory, shop stock, or gallery stock.</p>
            <img src="/heckmaster/img/guides/spatium-procuratio.gif" class="center">
            <p>I recommend using the first few of these grimoires you come across to get you more inventory space, since that's something you can't buy (unlike the shop and gallery expansions). Once you have a comfortable amount of space in your inventory and the price of your shop and gallery expansions rise, then it's worth using a Spatium Procuratio on the latter options.</p>
            <p>You can find them being sold at Brightvale Books or the Hidden Tower.</p>
            <hr>
            <!--Notes-->
            <h2 id="notes">Additional notes</h2>
            <p>While all grimoires are more commonly found in the Hidden Tower, they're also a lot more expensive there. I suggest taking a gander at all your options before buying from there, including user-owned shops.</p>
            <p>It's also possible to find them via random events. Spatium Procuratio actually has a dedicated random event, where the Shop Wizard will give you one.</p>
